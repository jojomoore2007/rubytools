# Welcome to RubyTools!
This site is mostly about, well, RubyTools. 
RubyTools is an idea created by Joey Moore(@jojomoore2007) to make Ruby easier to use.

The command is still in beta testing, but I have the [Dev1 Test](https://jojomoore2007.github.io/rubytools/command) version for you guys to try and make work. The first one to make it work in Ruby wins a Developer Account for MineWeb and for RubyTools.

Thanks for reading!
